- Ready for analytics and dashboards

*Project Overview*

This project designs and implements a relational database for a training institute (e.g., Besant Technologies) to manage and analyze the complete student lifecycle:

Enquiry → Enrollment → Batch → Course → Payment

The database is built considering real-world scenarios such as:

Multiple courses and subjects

Batch allocations

Instructor assignments

Student tracking

Revenue and performance analysis

The goal is to support both:

Operational needs (storing student data)

Analytical needs (dashboard and business insights)

*Business Problem*

Training institutes receive a large number of student enquiries through their website and offline channels.
However, not all enquiries convert into enrollments, and not all enrolled students complete payment.

The institute wants to answer questions such as:

How many enquiries convert into enrollments?

Which courses attract the most students?

Which batches perform best?

How much revenue is generated per course?

Which instructors handle the most students?

This database model is designed to capture and analyze these aspects efficiently.

*Objectives*

Design a normalized database schema for an educational institute

Track students from enquiry to enrollment

Manage courses, subjects, batches, and instructors

Enable revenue and performance analysis

Prepare data for BI tools and dashboards
